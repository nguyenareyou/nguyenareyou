# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, hi, how are you?

As I start my first year of university, I'm making the most out of my new school mail address!
*Meaning: claiming accredited university mail benefits everywhere, including GitHub.*
I don't know much about code, but I do know that many cool things on the Internet are made (and being made) here. Can't wait to learn more and contribute.
